# MTA Elf

This project was part of Columbia University's 2020 Summer Design Challenge with a goal of making making mass transit more safe post-COVID-19. The following code was used to analyze turnstile data put forward by the MTA, break it apart, and segment it for analysis. Additionally, work on the backend was done to accurately route MTA subway routes and display rider density from the collected and analyzed data.
