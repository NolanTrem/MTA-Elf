###The _purrfect_ public transportation assistant


A holistic and algorithmic approach to decrease overcrowding and the spread of Covid-19 on public transportation.
Focused on the democratization and accessibility of complex and ever-changing data for the public.

The feLine project was a multifaceted approach to solving and marketing a solution and, as a result, incorporates
aspects of backend algorithm development, web based visualization, a mobile user app, as well as a business plan.

This project was part of 
[Columbia University's 2020 Summer Design Challenge](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/transit-safety-post-covid-19)
with the goal of making mass transit safer post-Covid-19 under the direction of faculty leads Mysore Nagaraja and
Sharon Di. The project was awarded 1st place in the competition. Design guidelines follow:

>###Overview
> New York Cityâ€™s economy and livelihood depends heavily on the Mass Transit System (Subways, Buses, Commuter
> Railroads). Mass Transit carries 6 million people every day. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown,
> transit ridership has been reduced to about 10 percent. The challenge is how the system deals with crowds, buses,
> trains, and stations when NY City reopens for business. The MTA has already started closing the system for 4 hours
> every night to clean and disinfect stations and railcars thoroughly. What steps can the authorities take to control
> crush loads into stations and trains? What role should the citizens and businesses play in this effort? On the other
> hand, as Columbia has been preparing for ramping up labs with an emphasis on social distancing within the campus,
> higher risks could arise in the process when the employees commute between home and campus, especially those who
> have to take MTA transit. 
> ###Objectives
> This project aims to address travel safety and equity concerns of essential workers and provide a responsible, safe,
> and integrated transportation solution for the Columbia community and the general NYC population. To operate both the
> MTA system and Columbia transportation system safely when NYC reopens, your team will have the following potential
> design solutions:
>- A survey will be performed with the Columbia community to understand the travel patterns of essential workers.
>- To improve safe travel using MTA or Columbia transit service, we will understand the potential changes in behaviors
of transit riders. Also, how can we provide recommendations to suggest travelers to change their mobility pattern?
>- Any modifications to Station entrances, platforms etc and how effectively such modifications be accomplished in
> record time? How can we coordinate MTA and Columbia transportation service to ensure a seamless commute?
> ###Project Goal
> Your goal is to design a solution that will provide a safer, more reliable, and integrated transit system for the
> Columbia community and New Yorkers during episodes of elevated health risks, such as the waning periods of a pandemic
> or the perennial flu season.
> ###Assessment
> Your efforts will be judged according to:
> - Quality of Data Collected and sources. 
> - Criteria for Analysis
> - Recommendations for action:
>   - By MTA : for Operations/ Maintenance; and B. For Capital Improvement 
>   - By Businesses and Riding Public 
> - Recommendations for System-wide Implementation.
